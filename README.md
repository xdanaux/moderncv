#moderncv: a modern curriculum vitae class#

**Moderncv** provides a documentclass for typesetting curricula vitae in various
styles. Moderncv aims to be both straightforward to use and customizable,
providing five ready-made styles (classic, casual, banking, oldstyle and fancy)
and allowing one to define his own by modifying colors, fonts, icons, etc.

Most commands are defined in such a way that arguments are optional.

Here is one of the possible styles:
[fancy purple](examples/template_fancy_purple.pdf), you can find more in the 
[examples folder](/examples). Documents can be compiled into dvi, ps or pdf.
