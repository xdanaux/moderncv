- When using the "fancy" style, undesired space is added between the bibliography
  head and the first entry, as well as after the last entry
- Moderncv is incompatible with biblatex.
- Footnotes generates errors (though the output seem correct when running with
  "-interaction=nonstopmode")
- When using CJK, the last \clearpage required for fancyhdr to work properly kills
  the "lastpage" counter, hence also the page numbering.
- Moderncv produces an error ("lonely \item--perhaps a missing list environment")
  when used with bibentry, through the output is actually correct. Amongst other,
  this causes compilation by LyX to stop.
- The space after a cventry gets eaten up when the last argument contains a nested
  itemize environment. An ugly hack and incomplete solution was implemented by
  including a \strut in every item label, but this doesn't solve the problem for
  multi-line items. Ideally, the strut should end the item, but there seems to be
  no way to do this.
